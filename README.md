In case you want to reproduce figures using the code in this repository, following are some point to keep in mind.
* Due to run/machine dependent seed, the shape of UMAP may not match our figures but number of clusters and cell types should remain consistent.
* The cluster IDs after `FindClusters` step may be different for your run and it is important to change them based on the cell type in the code.
